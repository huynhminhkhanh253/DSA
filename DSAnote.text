Big O
    - O(n)                                                      (propotional - sum)
    - O(n^2) (most uneficient)                                  (loop in loop)
    - O(log n) ( how many time it takes to devide a list by 2)  (divide and conquer)
    - O(1) (most efficient)                                     (constant)
    - O(n logn) (some sorting algorithm)                        ()
